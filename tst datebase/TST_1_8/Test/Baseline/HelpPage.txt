 /?             Will display this help page.
 /Help          Will display this help page.
 /Server        Specifies the SQL Server that will be used. 
                Default is localhost.
 /QuickStart    It will setup the TST Quick Start database.
 /Setup         If specified, the script will create the TST 
                database version 1.8
                If the database 'TST' already exists and has 
                a version older than 1.8 then 
                it will be droped and recreated. 
                If the database 'TST' version 1.8 already exists 
                then the setup is aborted.
                If TST.BAT is run with no parameter, then /Setup is assumed.
 /NoVerCheck    Valid only with /Setup. If specified the script will
                create the TST database even if it already exists
                regardless of its existing version. 
 /NoPause       Takes efect only when used with /Setup.
                When specified the script will not display at the
                end "Hit any key to exit".
 /Force         Equivalent with /Setup /NoVerCheck /NoPause.
 /RunAll        It will run all the TST test procedures 
                from the database given by 'DatabaseToTest'
 /RunSuite      It will run all the TST test procedures 
                from the database given by 'DatabaseToTest' and which
                belong to the suite given by SuiteName
 /RunTest       It will run the TST test procedure with 
                the name given by TestName from the database 
                given by 'DatabaseToTest' 
 /Verbose       If /Verbose is not specified then only summary data, 
                failures and errors are included in the test report. 
                If /Verbose is specified all entries including the 
                informational log entries and the ‘Pass’ log entries are
                included in the test report.
 /XmlFormat     When specified it will dump the TST results
                in the file given by PathToXmlFile
 /NoTimestamp   When specified no timestamps and duration info will 
                be generated. Used to suport internal verification 
                scripts.
 /Set           Will set a TST variable. 
                TST variables are saved in the table Data.TSTVariables.
                TST Variables are defined per test database.
                Use NULL for the DatabaseName to set a global TST variable.
 /Get           Will display the values for all TST variables. 
 /UseEXIT       When specified it will set the ERRORLEVEL and exit 
                the script with the EXIT command.
                By default it will set the ERRORLEVEL by using 
                Exit /B which does not cause the current DOS shell 
                to be closed.
                Using /UseEXIT is needed when integrating with some tools
                in order to successfuly propagate the exit code. 

Exit Code:
    0 - Task(s) completed successfully.
    1 - There were errors completing the task(s).
        When the script is used to execute tests an exit code of 
        1 indicates that there were errors or failures.
